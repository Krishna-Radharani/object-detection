# Object Detection Using YOLO Algorithm and OpenCV

This project focuses on real-time object detection using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** algorithm and **OpenCV**. It identifies multiple objects in images or videos with high speed and accuracy.

## Features
- Detects multiple objects in real-time.
- Highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pre-trained YOLO weights
